  - title: I'm a data analyst with a background in marketing, analytics, and business strategy. I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to turn messy data into clear insights that drive performance. My experience spans campaign measurement, A/B testing, customer segmentation, and building dashboards that bring data to life. Iâ€™m especially interested in using data to solve real-world problems and guide smarter decisions.
