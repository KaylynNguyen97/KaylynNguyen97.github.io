            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I'm a data-driven problem solver passionate about transforming complex information into actionable insights. With a background in marketing analytics and data engineering, I enjoy building pipelines, dashboards, and predictive models that empower smarter business decisions.

                I’ve worked on projects ranging from customer churn prediction and smart parking availability systems to topic modeling with LLM embeddings. I’m fluent in tools like Python, R, SQL, Spark, and BigQuery, and have hands-on experience deploying models, orchestrating workflows with Airflow, and presenting findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
